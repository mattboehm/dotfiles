These are my config files. For now, it's primarily my .vimrc and plugins, but I'll probably incorporate more soon.

I'll try to add an installation script soon as well.

Vim notes:

* I use pathogen to manage vim plugins, so most plugins are subrepositories within .vim/bundle/
* Most of my mappings are in my .vimrc, but .vim/bundle/mbpython/ftplugin/python.vim has a few python-specific insert-mode mappings (like ; to _)
